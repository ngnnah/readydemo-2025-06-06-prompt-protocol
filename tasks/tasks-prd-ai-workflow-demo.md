### Notes

- Screenshots should be stored in PNG format in the assets directory with descriptive filenames
- The presentation should work both as a standalone Markdown document and as slides using a tool like Marp or reveal.js
- All examples should be prepared in advance to avoid live demo issues
- Consider recording the presentation as a backup option
