### Notes

- Screenshots should be stored in PNG format in the assets directory with descriptive filenames
- The presentation should work both as a standalone Markdown document and as slides using a tool like Marp or reveal.js
- All examples should be screenshot (step by step) in advance to avoid live demo issues, and to be used as documentation/guide thereafter
- Use Ready.net branding colors (Purple, Blue, Black) throughout the presentation
- Structure presentation to show the meta-example: using AI tools to create this presentation itself
