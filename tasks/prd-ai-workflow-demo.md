# Product Requirements Document: AI Tools Workflow Demo

## Introduction/Overview
This document outlines the requirements for creating a 5-8 minute demonstration of AI tools usage in a daily workflow for a SaaS telecom B2G company audience of 50 non-technical people. The demo will showcase how AI tools can 10x productivity using a structured workflow protocol, meta-prompting techniques, and other time-saving tips for working effectively with AI tools. The presentation will cut through AI hype and establish practical paths for AI tool adoption.

## Goals
1. Create a concise, engaging 5-8 minute presentation showcasing AI-powered productivity workflows
2. Demonstrate the 3-step AI workflow protocol with clear examples
3. Highlight meta-prompting techniques and show how they improve AI output quality
4. Present specific AI tools best suited for different tasks
5. Include artifacts/screenshots to provide concrete examples of the workflow
6. Ensure content is accessible to a non-technical audience while covering state-of-the-art techniques
7. Structure content to help audience establish their own path to AI tool adoption
8. Mention company's $2000 yearly AI upskilling stipend to make the presentation relevant to employees

## User Stories
1. As a non-technical employee, I want to understand how AI tools can be incorporated into my daily workflow so that I can improve my productivity.
2. As a manager, I want to see concrete examples of AI tool usage so that I can recommend adoption strategies to my team.
3. As a curious professional, I want to learn about current AI capabilities and limitations so that I can make informed decisions about which tools to invest time in learning.
4. As a company stakeholder, I want to understand the ROI of our AI upskilling investments so that I can justify continued support for these initiatives.

## Functional Requirements
1. **Presentation Format**: Create a structured slide deck or README-style document with screenshots that walks through the AI workflow. Consider a simple web app that generates/manages slides programmatically if time permits.

2. **Content Requirements**:
   1. Introduction to the concept of AI-assisted workflows (30 seconds)
   2. Overview of the 3-step AI workflow protocol (1 minute)
      - Generate PRD
      - PRD to tasks (stage-gate)
      - Execute tasks step-by-step
   3. Demonstration of meta-prompting techniques (1-2 minutes)
      - XML system prompts
      - Prompt folding (iterating on prompts)
      - Examples and escape hatches
   4. Showcase of specific AI tools and their optimal use cases (2-3 minutes)
      - VSCode Copilot/Edit mode
      - Google AI Studio
      - Claude Prompt Writer
      - NotebookLM
      - Lucid Charts with MermaidJS (diagram as code)
   5. Real-world application examples (1-2 minutes)
      - Calix Cloud integration
      - Generating diagrams and process flows
      - Data workflow optimization
   6. Best practices and tips for effective AI tool use (1 minute)
      - Proper context setting
      - Tool selection based on task complexity
      - Iterative prompt refinement
   7. Mention of company's $2000 yearly AI upskilling stipend (15 seconds)
   8. Q&A/conclusion (30 seconds)

3. **Visual Elements**:
   1. Screenshots of each step in the workflow
   2. Before/after examples showing improvement with better prompting
   3. Simple diagrams illustrating the 3-step workflow
   4. Examples of generated artifacts (diagrams, code, documents)

4. **Demo Flow**:
   1. Begin with a concrete problem statement
   2. Show the step-by-step application of the 3-step protocol
   3. Highlight key decision points and tool selection criteria
   4. Present the final output and demonstrate the time/effort saved

5. **Key Messaging Points**:
   1. AI as a companion/assistant/mentor, not just a tool
   2. "You get out what you put in" - importance of proper prompting
   3. Structure leads to better results - less guesswork, better outputs
   4. Using the right tool for the right job
   5. The importance of evaluation in AI workflows

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
1. Deep technical explanations of how AI models work
2. Extensive coding examples or complex technical implementations
3. Exhaustive coverage of all available AI tools
4. Hands-on workshop or extensive training (this is an overview demo)
5. Discussion of AI ethics or regulatory concerns
6. Comparison of specific vendor offerings or pricing details

## Design Considerations
1. Keep slides visually simple with minimal text
2. Use a consistent visual structure throughout
3. Incorporate screenshots and visual examples
4. Consider using a simple color scheme that matches company branding
5. If using a web app for presentation, ensure it has simple navigation controls

## Technical Considerations
1. Prepare all screenshots and examples in advance to avoid live demo risks
2. If creating a web-based presentation, use simple HTML/CSS/JS for reliability
3. Consider having backup examples ready in case of questions
4. Ensure all links and resources are accessible on the presentation device
5. Test the presentation flow on the actual equipment that will be used

## Success Metrics
1. Audience engagement during the presentation (questions, note-taking)
2. Post-presentation inquiries about specific tools or techniques
3. Increased adoption of AI tools among team members
4. Requests for follow-up sessions or more detailed information
5. Positive feedback from management on practical applicability

## Open Questions
1. Should specific company projects or use cases be highlighted in the presentation?
2. What is the technical setup for the online presentation (platform, screen sharing capabilities)?
3. Will there be time for a Q&A session after the presentation?
4. Should handout materials be provided for reference after the presentation?
5. Is there interest in follow-up sessions on specific aspects of AI tool usage?
6. What are the primary pain points or workflow challenges that audience members currently face?
7. Are there specific productivity metrics the company is trying to improve?
