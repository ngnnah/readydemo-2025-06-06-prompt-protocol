# Visual Assets for Presentation

The following visual assets need to be created or found for the presentation:

## 1. "You get out what you put in" Visual Metaphor
Create or find an image that visually represents the concept that AI output quality directly correlates with input quality.

**Ideas:**
- A funnel with high-quality inputs at the top and high-quality outputs at the bottom
- A garden metaphor showing quality seeds producing quality plants
- A "garbage in, garbage out" vs "quality in, quality out" side-by-side comparison

**Save as:** `./assets/quality-in-quality-out.png`

## 2. "AI as companion/assistant/mentor" Imagery
Find or create an image that depicts AI as a collaborative partner rather than just a tool.

**Ideas:**
- A person and AI working side by side (not AI replacing the person)
- A mentor/apprentice visual that shows AI assisting but human directing
- A collaborative workspace with AI suggestions and human judgment

**Save as:** `./assets/ai-companion.png`

## 3. "Vibe coding for serious adults" Meme
Create or find a meme that illustrates the structured yet intuitive approach to working with AI.

**Ideas:**
- A "professional on the outside, creative on the inside" split image
- A developer with structured code on one monitor and creative AI conversations on another
- A humorous take on "business in the front, party in the back" applied to coding

**Save as:** `./assets/vibe-coding.png`

## 4. Claude Prompt Writer Reference
Create a screenshot or example image showing the Claude Prompt Writer interface or output.

**Ideas:**
- Screenshot of the Claude interface with the prompt-generator project
- Sample output showing how Claude helps craft better prompts
- Before/after example of a basic prompt vs. an improved prompt from Claude

**Save as:** `./assets/claude-prompt-writer.png`

## Creating These Assets

You can create these assets using:

1. **AI Image Generation Tools:**
   - DALL-E (via ChatGPT)
   - Midjourney
   - Stable Diffusion

2. **Stock Image Sites:**
   - Unsplash.com
   - Pexels.com
   - iStock.com

3. **Screenshot + Annotation:**
   - Take screenshots of actual AI interactions
   - Annotate with arrows, highlights, or callouts to emphasize key concepts
   - Use tools like Snagit, Skitch, or built-in OS screenshot tools

When creating or selecting images, ensure they align with the Ready.net brand colors (Purple, Blue, Black) and maintain a professional yet engaging style suitable for a business presentation.
