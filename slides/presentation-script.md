# AI Workflow Demo - 6-Minute Script

## Introduction (30 seconds)
"Welcome everyone! Today I'll show you how I use AI tools to 10x my productivity with a structured workflow. In 2025, we're drowning in AI tools and updates, but I've found a system that works reliably across almost any task. AI is like magic - your command of the 'spell language' (prompts) and imagination determine your results."

## The 3-Step Protocol (1 minute)
"My workflow follows a simple 3-step protocol:

1. **Generate PRD**: I start with a clear goal, then AI helps define requirements through clarifying questions.
   [POINT TO PRD SLIDE]
   "This presentation itself started as a simple prompt, followed by AI asking questions to refine requirements."

2. **PRD to Tasks**: AI converts requirements into structured tasks.
   [POINT TO TASK LIST SLIDE]
   "Notice how this creates a clear roadmap with parent and sub-tasks."

3. **Execute Tasks**: Work through tasks step-by-step with AI assistance.
   [POINT TO EXECUTION SLIDE]
   "Each completed task builds momentum and visual progress."

## Meta-Prompting Techniques (1 minute)
"The secret to better AI results is meta-prompting:

1. **XML Structured Prompts**: Define role and constraints clearly
2. **Prompt Folding**: Let AI iteratively improve your prompts
3. **Examples and Escape Hatches**: Show what you want and plan for errors

As Guillermo Rauch of Vercel says, 'I've been an engineer for decades and I no longer write code. I only prompt.'"

## Tool Selection (1.5 minutes)
"Different tools excel at different tasks:

1. **VSCode with Copilot**: Fast coding, quick edits
2. **Google AI Studio**: Handles complex context with larger windows
3. **RepoPrompt**: Optimizes code context for AI consumption
4. **Claude Prompt Writer**: Crafts better prompts with clarifying questions
5. **Context is KEY**: Smart input → better output → knowledge base

[POINT TO CONTEXT SLIDES]
"This cycle of providing quality context dramatically improves results."

## Real-World Examples (1 minute)
"Beyond this presentation, I've used this workflow for:

1. **Data/Calix Cloud Integration**: From requirements to diagrams to code
   [POINT TO DIAGRAM SLIDES]
   "MermaidJS diagrams became Lucid Charts, which guided development."

2. **Documentation**: Auto-generating comprehensive guides with visual elements"

## ROI and Best Practices (30 seconds)
"The company offers $2000/year for AI upskilling. At just 1 hour saved per day, that's 250 hours annually - or $12,500 at $50/hour. That's a 625% ROI!

Best practices:
- Provide rich context
- Choose the right tool for each task
- Iterate on prompts
- Follow the structured protocol"

## Closing (30 seconds)
"Remember - AI is like magic. Tools will evolve, but mastering this workflow remains valuable. You don't need to chase every AI update to benefit significantly.

Join the AI revolution now - master the spells rather than be left behind watching others succeed.
